		;		copies two values into R0 and R1 respectively then puts the sum into R2
		
		MOV		R0, #01 	; 	see file MOV for more info about this instruction
		;		^ copies the value #01 into register 0
		
		MOV		R1, #02 ;	copies #02 into R1
		
		;		add intruction
		;		add takes in 3 paramters
		;		the first is the destination (as a register, IE, R1, R2, etc...) and 2 and 3 are the values you would like to add
		
		
		ADD		R2, R0, R1 	;	adds the values in R0 and R1 and copies them into R2
		
		;		you cannot simply add two hex values together as so:  (uncommenting will result in error)
		
		;		ADD		R3, #01, #03
		
		;		however, you can add a hex value to an existing value in a register like so,
		
		ADD		R3, R4, #03
